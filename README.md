## Pre-installation

Before running or contribute to this project, you need to have the setup of the following packages in your environment:

-   node
-   npm
-   git (for `contribution`)

## Quick start

1.  **Fork the project**

    In order to work on your own version of the Deriv application, please fork the project to your own repo.

2.  **Clone using SSH**

    ```sh
    git@github.com:deriv-com/smartcharts-champion.git
    ```

3.  **Enter project directory**

In the `app` folder, we provide a working webpack project that uses the smartcharts library. Simply `cd` to that directory.

4.  **Install your dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

5.  **To start developing:**

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

6.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The sample app should be running in `http://localhost:8080`.

### Other useful commands:

- use `npm install` to install dependencies
- use `npm start` to launch webpack dev server
- use `npm run build` to build the library
- use `npm run build:app` to build the app
- use `npm run analyze` to run webpack-bundle-analyzer
- use `npm run test` to run unit tests
- use `npm run coverage` to see test coverage

> Note: eventhough both `npm run build` and `npm run build:app` outputs `smartcharts.js` and `smartcharts.css`, **they are not the same files**. One outputs a library and the the other outputs an app.

## Usage

You can install the library using one of the following commands:

Using npm:

```bash
$ npm install @deriv-com/smartcharts-champion
```

Using yarn:

```bash
$ yarn add @deriv-com/smartcharts-champion
```


You can refer to library usage inside `app/index.tsx`:

```jsx
import { SmartChart } from '@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion';

class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <SmartChart
                // For handling history data
                getQuotes={({ symbol, granularity, count, start, end, style }) => Promise}
                // For subscribing to real-time quotes
                subscribeQuotes={({ symbol, granularity }, callback) => unsubscribeFunction}
                // For forgetting subscriptions
                unsubscribeQuotes={(request) => {}}
                // Optional: Pass chart data for updates
                chartData={{
                    tradingTimes: {...},
                    activeSymbols: [...]
                }}
                // Control whether to fetch data from API
                feedCall={{ activeSymbols: false, tradingTimes: false }}
            />
        );
    }
};
```

SmartCharts expects library user to provide `getQuotes`, `subscribeQuotes` and `unsubscribeQuotes`. Refer to [API](#api) for more details.

The job of loading the active symbols or trading times or stream data from cache or retrieving from websocket is therefore NOT the responsibility of SmartCharts but the host application. SmartCharts simply makes the requests and expect a response in return.

Some important notes on your webpack.config.js (refer to `app/webpack.config.js`):

- smartcharts CSS file will need to be copied from the npm library (remember to include in your `index.html`).
- smartcharts consist of a few chunks (which has filenames `*.smartcharts.*`), which it downloads asynchronously during runtime. Therefore, it needs to know where the library user places its chunks via the `setSmartChartsPublicPath` function:

```js
import { setSmartChartsPublicPath } from "@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion";

// SmartCharts chunk are deployed to https://mysite.com/dist/*
setSmartChartsPublicPath("/dist/");
// or 
setSmartChartsPublicPath("node_modules/@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion/dist/")
```

You can use the `copy-webpack-plugin` webpack plugin to copy over SmartCharts chunks:

```js
new CopyWebpackPlugin([
  { from: "./node_modules/@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion/dist/*.smartcharts.*" },
  { from: "./node_modules/@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion/dist/smartcharts.css" },
]);
```

You would also need to copy `node_modules/@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion/dist/chart/assets` to assets folder in the root of the project using CopyWebpackPlugin.

### API

The chart will request new data via Feed in a sequence that is calculated regards markets trading time. | `{trading_times: {markets: [{ name: 'Forex', submarkets: [{ name: 'Major Pairs', symbols: [{name: 'AUD/JPY', symbol: 'frxAUDJPY', times: { close: ['23:59:59'], open: ['00:00:00'], settlement: '23:59:59' }, trading_days: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri'],events: [{ dates: 'Fridays', descrip: 'Closes early (at 20:55)' },{ dates: '2020-12-25', descrip: 'Christmas Day' },{ dates: '2021-01-01', descrip: "New Year's Day" }], ...}, ]},...]...],}}`
| masterData | An array of ticks that are used to load the graph (candles). Default is `null`. If the Feed is available, the chart will call `fetchInitialData` via Feed to get the initial ticks, for old data it calls `fetchPaginationData` and receives new ticks constantly. If this property is filled, chart user `symbol` property and `setting` property (to extract chart type and interval) and the masterData to load the graph. **Notice:** chart interval in the setting property should be the same as masterData epoch/Date property. If the symbol property does not fill, the chart uses the `symbol` property that exists in the localStorage with the key of `layout-*`, and if that property also does not fill, the chart throws a console error. **(if the desired symbol does not fill in the `symbol` property or `layout-*` localStorage, it caused the chart to just load the given masterData and does not call for the `fetchInitialData` API)**. | `[{"Date":"2020-11-16T04:28:00", "Close":8287.85}, {"Date":"2020-11-16T04:26:00", "Open":8283.25,"High":8293.750015,"Low":8278.75,"Close":8293.75},...]`

#### Barriers API

`barriers` props accepts an array of barrier configurations:

```jsx
<SmartChart
  barriers={[
    {
      color: "green",
      shade: "above",
      hidePriceLines: false, // default false
      onChange: console.warn.bind(console),
    },
  ]}
/>
```

Attributes marked with `*` are **mandatory**:

| onChange             | When price of high or low barrier changes (including when switched toggling `relative` or setting `high\|low`), `onChange` will pass the high and low barriers as `{ high, low }`. |
| relative             | Toggle between relative and absolute barriers. Defaults to `false`.                                                                                                                |
| draggable            | Toggles whether users can drag the price lines and change the barrier directly from the chart. Defaults to `true`.                                                                 |

| isSingleBarrier      | Shows only High barrier, stops low barrier & shades from rendering when the flag is true. Defaults to `false`.                                                                     |
| showOffscreenArrows  | hide/show arrows with direction when the barrier is offscreen. Defaults to `false`.                                                                                                |

### Handling Type Errors in StreamManager.ts

When working with the StreamManager.ts file, you might encounter TypeScript errors due to type assertions or complex type relationships. Here are several ways to handle these type errors:

1. **Using `// @ts-ignore` comment**:
   - Place this comment directly above the line with the type error
   - This tells TypeScript to ignore any errors on the next line
   ```typescript
   // @ts-ignore
   this._connection.send((request as unknown) as TBinaryAPIRequest);
   ```

2. **Using `// @ts-nocheck` comment**:
   - Place this at the top of the file to ignore all type errors in the entire file
   - Use this sparingly as it disables type checking for the whole file
   ```typescript
   // @ts-nocheck
   import { ... } from '...';
   ```

3. **Using type assertions**:
   - Already used in the file with `as unknown as Type`
   - This is a two-step assertion that first converts to `unknown` and then to the desired type
   ```typescript
   (data.echo_req as unknown) as TGetQuotes
   ```

4. **Using the `any` type**:
   - The nuclear option that bypasses type checking completely
   - Use with caution as it removes all type safety
   ```typescript
   const response: any = await this._connection.send(request);
   ```

Choose the approach that best fits your specific situation, but try to minimize the use of type bypassing to maintain type safety where possible.

### Example Usage with Dummy Values

Here's an example of how to use the SmartCharts component with dummy values:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { SmartChart } from '@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion';

// Sample active symbols data
const dummyActiveSymbols = [
  {
    allow_forward_starting: 0,
    display_name: 'AUD/JPY',
    exchange_is_open: 1,
    is_trading_suspended: 0,
    market: 'forex',
    market_display_name: 'Forex',
    pip: 0.001,
    submarket: 'major_pairs',
    submarket_display_name: 'Major Pairs',
    symbol: 'frxAUDJPY',
    symbol_type: 'forex'
  },
  // Add more symbols as needed
];

// Sample trading times data
const dummyTradingTimes = {
  'frxAUDJPY': {
    isOpen: true,
    openTime: '2023-01-01T00:00:00Z',
    closeTime: '2023-01-01T23:59:59Z'
  },
  // Add more trading times as needed
};

// Sample historical data
const dummyMasterData = [
  {
    Date: '2023-01-01T00:00:00',
    Open: 95.25,
    High: 95.50,
    Low: 95.00,
    Close: 95.35
  },
  {
    Date: '2023-01-01T01:00:00',
    Open: 95.35,
    High: 95.75,
    Low: 95.20,
    Close: 95.60
  },
  // Add more candles as needed
];

const ChartExample = () => {
  // Function to fetch historical tick data
  const getQuotes = ({ symbol, granularity, count, start, end, style }) => {
    console.log('Fetching tick history for:', { symbol, granularity, count, start, end, style });
    
    // Return a promise that resolves with candles or history data
    if (style === 'ticks') {
      // For tick style, return history with times and prices
      return Promise.resolve({
        history: {
          times: dummyMasterData.map(candle => new Date(candle.Date).getTime() / 1000),
          prices: dummyMasterData.map(candle => candle.Close)
        }
      });
    } else {
      // For candle style, return candles
      return Promise.resolve({
        candles: dummyMasterData.map(candle => ({
          open: candle.Open,
          high: candle.High,
          low: candle.Low,
          close: candle.Close,
          epoch: new Date(candle.Date).getTime() / 1000
        }))
      });
    }
  };

  // Function to subscribe to real-time quotes
  const subscribeQuotes = ({ symbol, granularity }, callback) => {
    console.log('Subscribing to quotes for:', { symbol, granularity });
    
    // Simulate real-time updates with an interval
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      const lastPrice = 95 + Math.random();
      const quote = {
        Date: new Date().toISOString(),
        Close: lastPrice,
        DT: new Date(),
        tick: {
          quote: lastPrice,
          epoch: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
        }
      };
      
      callback(quote);
    }, 1000);
    
    // Return an unsubscribe function
    return () => {
      console.log('Unsubscribing from quotes for:', { symbol, granularity });
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  };

  // Function to forget subscriptions
  const unsubscribeQuotes = (request) => {
    console.log('Forgetting subscription for:', request);
    // In a real implementation, you would handle unsubscribing from the WebSocket here
  };

  // Function to calculate indicator height ratio
  const getIndicatorHeightRatio = (chart_height, indicator_count) => {
    const isSmallScreen = chart_height < 780;
    const denominator = indicator_count >= 5 ? indicator_count : indicator_count + 1;
    const reservedHeight = 320;
    const indicatorsHeight = Math.round(
      (chart_height - (reservedHeight + (isSmallScreen ? 20 : 0))) / denominator
    );
    
    return {
      height: indicatorsHeight,
      percent: indicatorsHeight / chart_height,
    };
  };

  return (
    <SmartChart
      id="example-chart"
      symbol="frxAUDJPY"
      getQuotes={getQuotes}
      subscribeQuotes={subscribeQuotes}
      unsubscribeQuotes={unsubscribeQuotes}
      chartType="candle"
      granularity={60} // 1-minute candles
      getIndicatorHeightRatio={getIndicatorHeightRatio}
      feedCall={{ activeSymbols: false, tradingTimes: false }}
      isAnimationEnabled={true}
      enabledNavigationWidget={true}
      isLive={true}
    />
  );
};

export default ChartExample;
```

In this example:

1. We define dummy data for active symbols, trading times, and historical candles.
2. We implement the required functions:
   - `getQuotes`: Returns historical data for the chart
   - `subscribeQuotes`: Subscribes to real-time quotes and returns an unsubscribe function
   - `unsubscribeQuotes`: Handles unsubscribing from data streams
   - `getIndicatorHeightRatio`: Calculates the height for indicators
3. We configure the SmartChart component with various props:
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the chart
   - `symbol`: The trading symbol to display
   - `chartType`: Set to "candle" for candlestick chart
   - `granularity`: Set to 60 for 1-minute candles
   - Other configuration options for appearance and behavior

This example demonstrates how to set up a SmartCharts component with dummy data for development or testing purposes.

#### Marker API

Use `FastMarker` to render given components inside the chart.
Markers provide a way for developers to place DOM elements that are positioned based on date, values or tick location inside the chart. Also, please note that this `FastMarker` implementation does not factor the width and height of the marker: this is expensive to calculate, so we expect you to offset this in CSS.
`FastMarker` will keep the marker position on the chart.
It can be imported from `@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion` package either as `FastMarker`, or simply as `Marker`.

```jsx
<SmartChart>
  <FastMarker
    markerRef={setRef}
    className="your-css-class"
  >
    <your content here/>
  </FastMarker>
</SmartChart>

```

USAGE:

- `setRef({setPosition, div})` will be called onMount.
- `setRef(null)` will be called when the marker unmounts.
- `div` is the dom element containing the marker with `your-css-class`
  - any content update should be done using `div` and vanilla js
  - use `div.querySelector('...')` to get a dom reference in order to update your content.
  - avoid doning expensive DOM operations on `div` such as style changes.
- `setPosition({epoch, price})` is a function that you will use to update the `div` position.
  - epoch is the tick unix epoch from api
  - price is the tick price, it could be `null` if you want to draw a vertical line.
- call `setPosition({epoch: null, price: null})` to hide the marker.

PROPS:

- `markerRef` (required): pass the `setRef` callback using this property
- `className` (optional): avoid expoensive css transition or keyframe animations on this class.

### Raw Marker API

Get a raw callback with underlying canvas2dcontext.
This component is used to render directly into the chart canvas.

PROPS:

- `epoch_array`: array of epoch values to get coordinates for.
- `draw_callback`: called on every frame with ({ctx, points}).
  - `points` will be an array of [{left, top, epoch}] in pixels.
  - `ctx` is the Context2dDrawingContext

### Customising Components

We offer library users full control on deciding which of the top widgets and chart control buttons to be displayed by overriding the render methods themselves. To do this you pass in a function to `chartControlsWidgets` or `topWidgets`.

For example, we want to remove all the chart control buttons, and for top widgets to just show the comparison list (refer `app/index.jsx`):

```jsx
import { ChartMode, ToolbarWidget } from "@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion";

const renderTopWidgets = () => (
  <React.Fragment>
    <div>Hi I just replaced the top widgets!</div>
    <ChartMode />
  </React.Fragment>
);

const renderBottomWidgets = () => (
  <React.Fragment>
    <div>Hi, I am a bottom widget!</div>
  </React.Fragment>
);

const renderToolbarWidgets = () => (
  <ToolbarWidget position="top">
    <div>Hi I just replaced the top widgets!</div>
    <ChartMode />
  </ToolbarWidget>
);

const App = () => (
  <SmartChart
    bottomWidgets={renderBottomWidgets}
    topWidgets={renderTopWidgets}
    toolbarWidget={renderToolbarWidgets}
    chartControlsWidgets={() => {}}
  ></SmartChart>
);
```

Here are the following components you can import:

- Top widgets:
  - `<ChartTitle enabled={true} onChange={(symbol) => {}} open_market={null} />`
- Chart controls:
  - `<CrosshairToggle enabled={true} />`
  - `<ChartTypes enabled={true} onChange={(chartType) => {}} />`
  - `<StudyLegend />`
  - `<DrawTools />`
  - `<Views onChartType={(chartType) => {}} onGranularity={(granularity) => {}} />`
  - `<Share />`
  - `<Timeperiod enabled={true} onChange={(chartType) => {}} />`
  - `<ChartSize />`
  - `<ChartSetting />`
- Toolbar Widget
  - `<ChartMode onChartType={(chartType) => {}} onGranularity={(granularity) => {}} />`

> Note: ChartMode and Views have the same type of props. It includes required `onChartType` and `onGranularity` callbacks and an optional `portalNodeId`.


### Props vs UI

Certain chart parameters can be set either by props or from the chart UI:

- `symbol` - set by `<ChartTitle />`
- `granularity` - set by `<TimePeriod >`
- `chartType` - set by `<ChartTypes />`

This creates conflicts in deciding which is the single source of truth. To circumvent this, if these props are set (not `undefined`), selecting options in its corresponding components will not have any affect on the chart; the prop values take precedence. To have control over both the UI and the props, we provide library users the option to _override_ component behaviour via `onChange` prop. For example, to retrieve the symbol a client chooses:

```jsx
<ChartTitle
  open_market={{
    category: 'forex',
    subcategory: 'minor-pairs',
    market: 'frxAUDCAD'
  }}
  onChange={(symbol) => {
    /* ...Pass to symbol prop in <SmartCharts /> */
  }}
/>
```

See available components and their props in [Customising Components](#customising-components).

#### ChartTitle

| Attribute    | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| onChange     | When symbol/market changes, this method call. `(symbol) => { }`                                     |
| isNestedList | Change the theme of Dropdown, if set to `true` it shows a dropdown nested style. Default is `false` |
| open_market | Sepecify the visible market on the market selector scroll. it accept `{category: '', subcategory: '', market: ''}` . Default is `null` |


#### ToolbarWidget

| Attribute | Description                                                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| position  | determine the position of toolbar, which can be `top, bottom`. Default is `top` |

## Manage releases / deployment process
### Library deployment / publishing to NPM

To publish to production:

    ```sh
    npm run build && npm publish
    ```


## Manage translations

All strings that need to be translated must be inside `t.translate()`:

```js
t.translate("[currency] [amount] payout if the last tick.", {
  currency: "USD",
  amount: 43.12,
});
t.setLanguage("fr", callback_function); // components need to be rerendered for changes to take affect
```

### Debugging NPM Package

Some issues only show up for library users, so it is helpful to test the NPM package before deploying it to library users. You can do this by building the library directly into the node_modules directory of an app that uses the SmartCharts library. For example to test the library build on binary-static you can execute:

    npm run watch '../binary-static/node_modules/@deriv-com/smartcharts-champion/dist'

Now each time you make any change, it will overwrite the SmartCharts library inside the `node_modules` folder.

### Separation of App and Library

There should be a clear distinction between developing for app and developing for library. Library source code is all inside `src` folder, whereas app source code is inside `app`.

Webpack determines whether to build an app or library depending on whether an environment variable `BUILD_MODE` is set to `app`. Setting this variable switches the entry point of the project (app build mode uses `app/index.jsx` while library uses `src/index.js`). We do it this way to develop the app to have hot reload available when we modify library files.

### Dealing With SVGs

SmartCharts has 2 ways of utilizing SVG files: as CSS background image and as external SVG.

##### CSS Background Image SVG

These SVG are added inline into the CSS via [postcss-inline-svg](https://github.com/TrySound/postcss-inline-svg). Currently the only place where this is used is the loader, because if the external SVG is not loaded yet we would at least want a loading screen to be present.

##### External SVG

The SVG files included in the `js` and `jsx` files are automatically put together into a sprite sheet. Manipulating external SVG can be tricky - developers can only control stroke and fill color of the whole SVG file via CSS:

```scss
.ic-icon.active {
  svg {
    stroke: #2e8836;
    fill: #ff3d38;
  }
}
```

**Important Note:** These stroke and fill colors will not be affected by CSS if the corresponding attributes are declared in the SVG file. Therefore, it is not uncommon SmartCharts developers would need to tweak the SVG files by hand to be able to manipulate its color.

This has much less freedom compared to [inline SVG](https://github.com/MoOx/react-svg-inline) where a developer can control individual parts of the SVG, but having external SVG results in a much smaller library, and allows parts of the code not rendered by React to use them. External SVG is also cached by the browser (using shadow DOM), so though the same SVG may be used multiple times, only one copy exists in the DOM.

### State Management and the `connect` Method

SmartCharts uses a variation of [Mobdux](https://medium.com/@cameronfletcher92/mobdux-combining-the-good-parts-of-mobx-and-redux-61bac90ee448) to assist with state management using Mobx.

Each component consists of 2 parts: a **template** (`*.jsx` file), and a **store** (`*Store.js` file). There are 3 scenarios in which the [`connect`](https://github.com/deriv-com/SmartCharts/blob/dev/src/store/Connect.js) method is used:

##### 1. Main Components: The component is tied directly to the main store.

Examples: `<ChartTitle />`, `<TimePeriod />`, `<Views />`...

Each component here is mapped to a corresponding store in the main store. **Only one copy of this component may exist per `<SmartChart />` instance**, and its state is managed by the main store tree (defined as `mainStore` in SmartCharts). Here you pass a `mapperFunction` that would be applied directly to the main store:

```jsx
function mapperFunction(mainStore) {
  return {
    value: mainStore.subStore.value,
  };
}

export default connect(mapperFunction)(MyComponent);
```

Connections in the scenario #1 should be done in the `jsx` file, to keep consistent with other components. Except for the component tied to the main store (`Chart.jsx`), all components using this method should be SFC (Stateless Functional Components), and have the lifecycle managed by the main store.

##### 2. Subcomponents: Component is connected inside a store

Examples: `<Menu />`, `<List />`, `<CategoricalDisplay />`...

This is used when multiple copies of a store needs to exist in the same state tree. Here we do the connection inside the constructor of a child of the main store and pass it as a prop to the template. For example `<ChartTitle />` needs a `<Menu />`, so in `ChartTitleStore` we create an instance of `MenuStore` and connect it:

```js
export default class ChartTitleStore {
  constructor(mainStore) {
    this.menu = new MenuStore(mainStore);
    this.ChartTitleMenu = this.menu.connect(Menu);
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The `connect` method for subcomponents are defined in its store (instead of the template file) that contains its own `mapperFunction`:

```js
export default class MenuStore {
  // ...
  connect = connect(() => ({
    setOpen: this.setOpen,
    open: this.open,
  }));
}
```

We then pass the connected component in `ChartTitle.jsx`:

```js
export default connect(({ chartTitle: c }) => ({
  ChartTitleMenu: c.ChartTitleMenu,
}))(ChartTitle);
```

> **Note**: Do NOT connect subcomponents in another connect method; `connect` creates a new component each time it is called, and a `mapperFunction` is called every time a mobx reaction or prop update is triggered.

##### 3. Independent Components: components that are not managed by the main store

Examples: `<Barrier />`, `<ChartMode />`

Independent components is able to access the main store, but the main store has no control over independent components. As such, each independent component manages its own life cycle. Here is the interface for its store:

```js
class IndependentStore {
  constructor(mainStore) {}
  updateProps(nextProps) {} // intercept the props from the component
  destructor() {} // called on componentWillUnmount
}
```

This enables library users to use multiple copies of a component without connecting it, because mounting an independent component will also create its own store (refer to [`Marker API`](#marker-api) to see usage example of such a component). Therefore, for each independent component you connect you will also need to pass its store class (not an instance but the class itself) as a second parameter to the `connect` function:

```jsx
function mapperFunction(customStore) {
  return {
    value: customStore.value,
  };
}

export default connect(
  mapperFunction,
  MyStoreClass // Required argument for independent components
)(MyIndependentComponent);
```

Note that **for independent components, the `mapperFunction` is applied to the store instance**, not the main store. Should you need to access any value from the main store, you can do this via the `mainStore` passed to the constructor of each independent store class.
